# 1. Import the data from medical_examination.csv and assign it to the df variable.
# This function typically gets df as an argument in the FCC test environment,
# but for self-containment and direct execution, we load it here.
# For the actual FCC submission, you might not load it in these functions if it's
# already loaded and passed from the main test file.

def draw_cat_plot():
    # Load data
    df = pd.read_csv('medical_examination.csv')

    # 2. Add an overweight column to the data.
    # Calculate BMI: weight in kilograms / (height in meters)^2
    # height is in cm, so convert to meters (divide by 100)
    df['bmi'] = df['weight'] / ((df['height'] / 100) ** 2)
    # If BMI > 25, set overweight to 1, else 0
    df['overweight'] = (df['bmi'] > 25).astype(int)

    # 3. Normalize data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad.
    # If the value of cholesterol or gluc is 1, set the value to 0.
    # If the value is more than 1, set the value to 1.

    # Melt df to create df_cat with 'cardio' as id_vars
    # and specified value_vars.

    # diastolic pressure is higher than systolic (ap_lo <= ap_hi)
    # height is less than the 2.5th percentile
    # height is more than the 97.5th percentile
    # weight is less than the 2.5th percentile
    # weight is more than the 97.5th percentile

    # 11. Calculate the correlation matrix and store it in the corr variable.
    # Exclude 'cholesterol', 'gluc', 'smoke', 'alco', 'active', 'overweight' columns for correlation
    # or ensure they are numeric. Let's make sure all relevant columns are numeric.
    # Need to normalize cholesterol, gluc and add overweight here too for consistency with cat_plot

# This part of the code will only run if the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).
